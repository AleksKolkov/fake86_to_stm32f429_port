# fake86_to_stm32f429_port
8086 PC emulator for STM32F429 MCU

This project is based on Core4X9I dev board.


I make a custom dev board with R-2R DAC for creating VGA image, holder for microSD card and USB A connector.

Thi biggest problem of this project is that CPU emulation speed is wery low - less than 1 MHz.
